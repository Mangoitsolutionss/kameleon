h3. scope selectors

goal is to provide abstraction for xpath / css selectors for common areas of application
* parts of page
** on (top|left|bottom|right)
** in main menu, footer
* tables sectors
** within row that contains sth
**default area (i.e without menus, columns and footer)


h3. verification that action complete with desirable state in app

goal is to distinct what user see from what browser see in the source

* see sth that is visible for user
** as text ( regex, string )
** as value in field { hash of pairs field (id|name), value }
** elements in proper order
* send in email (emails should be attached per user - mailbox)
* see in the source code (in debug mode)


h3. Interactions with applications
 * clicking
 * visiting
 * drag and drop
 * fill_in forms
   ** including rich text ('textarea', 'ckeditor', '')
  ** all type of inputs ('text', 'password', 'email', 'checkbox', 'radio', 'file', 'select', 'multi-select')
 * handling tricky testing parts in better manner
   ** popups
   ** frames / windows
   ** native windows (like confirmations)
 * support for common ui components
   ** jquery ui
     *** calendars
     *** sliders
     *** ...
   ** colorbox // other modalboxes
   **
 * all browser simulation handlers
   ** ... go back etc
 * all mouse and keyboard simulation
   ** hover over
 * using javascript (might be as debug mode)
   ** to trigger events that are hard to imitate
 * testing visibility of element (debug mode)


h3. user object
 * is ruby object with info about
   ** session
   ** user in system that he is (including not encrypted password)
   ** can perform many actions in will { ... }
   ** can login/logout
 * customization (specific classes for specific types of users)
   ** roles
   ** methods for setuping certain state of account (must to work well with factories and support bulk update to speed up things)


h3. handle somehow guest type of account

h3.  sessions (from browsers perspective)
   * be default share the same sessions
   * is possible that they have exclusive session ( when testing multiuser interactions)


h3. shared examples that are skeleton for testing
 * pagination
 * sorting
 * ...


h3. i18n support

using keys other that labels

h3. shortcuts to abstract some internal elements

long class names, constants etc


h3. see partial elemnts in what scope you are

print debug.send(:scopes).last.native

h3. see sorted columns
* ordered => [:asc, :column => 'Title']
* within :multiple need to be rewritten - is very ugly so far
* implement better keyboard support

h3. Other
* Make kameleon agnostic from devise, easier integrating other authentication solutions
* Add support for nice frame/window switching
* Support for interaction with mobile websites - sometimes you have to 'touch' an element, pull a slider, etc. To do so, you have to click around the specified text. And example:

bc.
  I18n.locale = :en
  translation = I18n.t(arg1)
  element = page.find(:xpath, "//span[contains(.,'#{arg1}') or contains(.,'#{translation}')]").find(:xpath, ".//..").find(:xpath, ".//..")
  element.click

* Support for "NOT see an image".
